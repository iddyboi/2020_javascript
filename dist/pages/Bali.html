          Bali is the most popular island holiday destination in the Indonesian
          archipelago. It’s home to an ancient culture that's known for its warm
          hospitality as well as exotic temples and palaces set against stunning
          natural backdrops. Dining in Bali presents endless choices of exotic,
          local cuisine. After sunset, famous nightspots come to life offering
          exciting clubbing and packed dance floors. Inland, towering volcanoes
          and pristine jungles offer plenty to see and do, but you won't want to
          stay away from the coastline for long. <br /><br />
          Popular beach resorts include Kuta, Seminyak and Jimbaran where many
          of the finest hotels and villas look over world-class surf spots. For
          tranquil seascapes and sunrises, Sanur, Nusa Dua and remote Candidasa
          are your best bets. Bali’s lesser travelled eastern and northern
          regions also offer wonderful diving spots in calm bays, with coral
          gardens teeming with colourful marine biodiversity.

        <p class="lead">
          When it comes to things to do in Bali, your holiday can be filled with
          culture, nature, art, and the spiritual. The spectacular beaches of
          Kuta, Nusa Dua and Seminyak offer hours of swimming, surfing and
          sunbathing, while the cultural area of Ubud is known for its
          picturesque rice terraces. Get away from the crowds by visiting the
          northern and eastern coasts, where hidden waterfalls wait to be
          discovered. Bali's west coast has tapering ranges of mountains covered
          in lush forests, rice fields, and bountiful vegetation. The island
          also has hundreds of historical sites that have stood the tests of
          time. From royal palaces to holy temples, you get to see a different
          glimpse of Bali at these exotic spots.
