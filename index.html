                  Software development is always growing and we need to always
                  learn, but I say some of us are missing soft skills to make
                  the job easier for us. These are a few skills I have to help
                  me become a better programmer, not just for me but for my
                  team.

                  I studied at the university of London South Bank studying Bsc
                  Computer Science. This degree lasted 3 years, which I learned
                  about , Data Structures and Algorithms, Mathematics for
                  Computer Science, Fundamentals of Software Development and
                  Principles of Data Networks in my first year.
                  <br /><br />
                  My second year consisted of Operating Systems,User Centred
                  Design, Object-Oriented Programming, Database Systems and
                  Fundamentals of Computer Science.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  In my third year I took on a final year project which managed
                  to create a system using Python and Javascript to create a
                  Movie Recommendation system using Machine learning with
                  Sci-kit learning module in Python.

                  I have always had the love for computers since i was toddler
                  but i wasn't the typical hacker/computer specialist in school.
                  I was the gamer and go to person in my family anytime someone
                  had a problem with their devices.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Football was my background in school, jumping from acadamies
                  to acadamies and playing for semi-pro teams across England.
                  When I was playing football I had spare time on my hands, I
                  would reguarly check Youtube for learning new skills. I then
                  came across an Ad from
                  <span class="green"><strong> Team Treehouse </strong> </span>
                  and I was intrigued by it, so I did a bit of background
                  research into learning how to code.

                  <br /><br />
                  The first Programming language i started of with was C++, and
                  my God was I puzzled. My very first code was to write the
                  typical
                  <span class="red">Hello World!</span>. I then challenged to
                  make bigger projects such as calculator, card game, tax
                  calculator for year 2015. <br /><br />
                  Because I was new to programming I wanted to know what else I
                  Could do, then i found out there were mutliple languages to
                  write in that specialise in different task. Examples can be
                  data analysis for python, web manipulation in Javascript,
                  Swift for IOS and so on

                  <br /><br />

                  5 Years later I have chosen my trade which is
                  <span class="blue">Javascript!</span>. Even though Javascript
                  is high level language, computers today are faster than
                  before! and because its written
                  <span class="red">synchronously</span> we can now write code
                  <span class="blue">asynchronous</span>
